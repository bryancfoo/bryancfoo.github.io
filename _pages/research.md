Collective Thomson scattering from non-Maxwellian plasmas
-------
Thomson scattering (TS) describes electromagnetic radiation scattered by populations of charged particles and is a commonly used diagnostic technique used to characterize laboratory plasmas. In the collective TS regime, the incident radiation is scattered by the correlated electron plasma waves  and ion acoustic waves which propogate through the plasma. This allows us to use measurements of the scattered radiation to probe both the electron and ion parameters. 

Most existing TS analysis tools assume that the plasma VDFs are Maxwellian, but non-Maxwellian VDFs are expected to occur in many laser plasma experiments. My work is on developing "forward models" which can compute the TS spectrum from non-Maxwellian VDFs, as well as "fitting algorithms" which can efficiently fit non-Maxwellian plasma parameters to a given TS spectrum, usually by some iterative appliation of a forward model.
