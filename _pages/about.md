Welcome to my website! I'm Bryan, an incoming first-year PhD student in the Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE) department at MIT. This site contains some information about me and my research. Most of the site is still being built, so don't be surprised if you see some template-looking pages.

My research is in plasma physics, specifically on high energy density physics. More information about my research can be found in the [Research](/research/) tab.
