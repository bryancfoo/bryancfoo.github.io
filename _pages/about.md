Welcome to my website! I'm Bryan, an incoming first-year PhD student in the Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE) department at MIT. This site contains some information about me and my research, as well as some other physics-related content. Most of the site is still being built, so don't be surprised if you see some template-looking pages.

My research is in plasma physics, specifically on high energy density physics. More information about my research can be found in the [Research](/research/) tab. My CV can be found at [CV](/cv/).

I enjoy teaching physics and keep some drafts of lecture notes I wrote on various topics in the [Physics Notes](/notes/) tab. Hopefully one day I'll get the chance to use them...

I also occasionally blog about interesting physics that's on my mind at [Blog Posts](/year-archive/).
